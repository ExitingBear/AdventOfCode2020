## Part 1
Change this into binary then find the max
```{r}
seatid<-sapply(input,function(x){
  x<-str_replace_all(x,"R|B","1")
  x<-str_replace_all(x,"F|L","0")
  x<-strtoi(x,2)
x})
part1<-max(seatid)
part1
```

## Part 2
Find all of the seats where the 1 higher is not in the list.  Find all the seats where the one lower is not in the list
The intersection of the lists is my seat
(The sample data does not include a valid seat.)

```{r}
part2<-intersect(
  seatid[which(!((seatid+1) %in% seatid))]+1,
  seatid[which(!((seatid-1) %in% seatid))]-1)
part2
```
